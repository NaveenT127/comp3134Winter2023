To mitigate the problem of exposing comments that contain sensitive information, 
we converted all HTML comments to PHP comments in the source code. This ensures that the 
comments are not visible in the page source and are only visible in the source code of the PHP 
file. By doing this, we can ensure that any sensitive information contained in the comments is not 
exposed to unauthorized individuals who may view the page source.
