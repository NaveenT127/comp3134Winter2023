The difference between using strip_tags() and htmlentities() to sanitize user input is that strip_tags() 
removes HTML tags from the input, while htmlentities() converts special characters to their corresponding 
HTML entities, preventing them from being interpreted as code by the browser.

strip_tags() can be useful when you want to allow some HTML tags but remove others. For example, you 
might allow <b> and <i> tags for bold and italic text, but remove <script> and <iframe> tags for security reasons.

On the other hand, htmlentities() is useful when you want to display user input on a web page 
without allowing any HTML tags. It converts special characters such as <, >, and & to their corresponding
HTML entities, which will be displayed as plain text by the browser.
