CSFR Test Results:

Scenario 1:

1. Navigated to csfr_form.php
2. Inspected the source code and confirmed the presence of the hidden form field "confirmation"
3. Submitted the form and was redirected to csfr_action.php
4. Inspected the source code and saw that the session variable "confirmation" was retrieved and compared to the post value "confirmation"
5. Received a success message indicating that the confirmation values matched

Scenario 2:

1. Navigated to csfr.html and inspected the source code
2. Obtained the random value of the PHP session variable "confirmation" by reading the source code
3. Created a new HTML file with a form that contained a hidden field named "confirmation" with the obtained value
4. Set the form's action attribute to point to csfr.php
5. Opened the new HTML file in a new tab and submitted the form
6. The form was successfully submitted without any prompt for user input, indicating a successful CSFR attack.
7. Overall, the implementation of the session variable check in csfr_action.php successfully prevented a CSFR attack in Scenario 1, while the absence of such check in the original csfr.php made it vulnerable to attack in Scenario 2.
