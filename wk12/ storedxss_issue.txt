The issue with the code is that it is vulnerable to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack. 
The code directly reads and outputs the contents of the text file without any sanitization or 
validation of the input, which means that any malicious code stored in the file will be executed 
when the page is loaded in the browser. This can lead to the attacker stealing sensitive user data, 
such as cookies or login credentials, or performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the user. It is
important to sanitize and validate all user input, whether it is stored or reflected, to prevent such 
attacks.<script>document.location.href="/directory_traversal_part1.php"</script>
